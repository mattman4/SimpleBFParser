# SimpleBFParser
Simple [BF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) parser in Haskell

## Usage
- Open file via [GHCi](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/ghci.html) and run `compexec "<your code>"`
- Some sample programs have been provided, for example `compexec squares` prints the first 100 square numbers (not written by me, relevant credits in source code).
- The output will be printed first during the exection, then after it has done the state of the tape will show in the format `[left values] value under data pointer [right values]`
